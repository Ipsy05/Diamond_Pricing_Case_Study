# EDA_Diamond_Pricing_Case_Study
Explore diamond characteristics and pricing trends using data analysis and visualization with Matplotlib in Python. Code for scatter plots, box plots, and insights. 

Embark on a fascinating journey into the world of diamonds with this comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) case study. This Jupyter notebook provides a deep dive into the intricate relationship between various diamond attributes and their prices. Leveraging Python and Matplotlib, the code showcases dynamic visualizations, including pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots.

A comprehensive summary of the Matplotlib graphs used, the insights gained, and the purpose behind each analysis in the EDA_Diamond_Pricing_Case_Study:

1.Histogram:

Purpose: Examined the frequency distribution of diamond prices.
Insight: Provided a detailed view of the distribution and concentration of diamond prices.

2.Pie Chart:

Purpose: Displayed the distribution of diamond cut qualities.
Insight: Visualized the proportion of different cut qualities in the dataset.

3.Scatter Plot:

Purpose: Investigated the variation of diamond prices with respect to carats.
Insight: Highlighted the general trend of increasing prices with carat weight and identified potential outliers.

4.Modified Scatter Plot:

Purpose: Addressed overcrowding by using smaller, more transparent markers.
Insight: Improved visibility of data points for a clearer analysis.

5.Box Plots:

Purpose: Explored the price variation across different cut categories.
Insight: Revealed the statistical distribution of prices for each cut type.

6.Modified Box Plots:

Purpose: Removed outliers above $12,500 for better analysis.
Insight: Cautioned about potential impacts on data averages and highlighted the median price differences.
Conclusion:

Insight: The median price of ideal cut diamonds is the least, and ideal cut has many outliers.
By employing these diverse Matplotlib visualizations, the repository provides a holistic exploration of diamond characteristics and pricing trends. The analyses offer valuable insights for both beginners and experienced data analysts, showcasing the power of data visualization in uncovering patterns and making informed observations.
